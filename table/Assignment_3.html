            There are many ways in which we can maintain peace at different levels. To begin with humankind, it is essential to maintain equality, security and justice to maintain the political order of any nation.

Further, we must promote the advancement of technology and science which will ultimately benefit all of humankind and maintain the welfare of people. In addition, introducing a global economic system will help eliminate divergence, mistrust and regional imbalance.

It is also essential to encourage ethics that promote ecological prosperity and incorporate solutions to resolve the environmental crisis. This will in turn share success and fulfil the responsibility of individuals to end historical prejudices.

            Spirituality involves the recognition of a feeling or sense or belief that there is
something greater than myself, something more to being human than sensory
experience, and that the greater whole of which we are part is cosmic or divine in
nature.
Spirituality means knowing that our lives have significance in a context beyond a
mundane everyday existence at the level of biological needs that drive selfishness
and aggression. It means knowing that we are a significant part of a purposeful
unfolding of Life in our universe.
Spirituality involves exploring certain universal themes â€“ love, compassion, altruism,
life after death, wisdom and truth, with the knowledge that some people such as
saints or enlightened individuals have achieved and manifested higher levels of
development than the ordinary person. Aspiring to manifest the attributes of such
inspirational examples often becomes an important part of the journey through life for
spiritually inclined people
